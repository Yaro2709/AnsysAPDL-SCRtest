 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.203   TIME= 16:30:29
 The requested number of shared-memory processors (20) exceeds the       
 number of physical processors that are available (6).  The number of    
 processors used will be 6.                                              

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.484   TIME= 16:30:30
 The requested number of shared-memory processors (20) cannot be greater 
 than that specified by the ANSYS command line option -NP (6).           
  The number of processors used will be left at 6.

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.266   TIME= 17:18:49

 During this session a solution was performed using 6 CPU cores in       
 shared-memory parallel (SMP) mode (-np 6).  It is strongly recommended  
 to use distributed memory parallel (DMP) mode instead (-dis -np 6).     
 DMP mode typically outperforms SMP mode, even when running on a single  
 system.  For more information, see the ANSYS Parallel Processing Guide  
 in the ANSYS Help system.
